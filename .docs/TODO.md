# Undistracted Me — Roadmap & TODOs

## ✅ Done

### Core Architecture
- [x] Widget grid: drag, per-breakpoint layout persistence, dot-grid overlay
- [x] Design system: `--w-ink-*` tokens + typography classes in `App.css`
- [x] BaseWidget: 3-dot options menu, settings popover, forwardRef, click-outside
- [x] BaseSettingsModal: shared dialog shell with `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`
- [x] **Zustand stores** (5 total): `useSettingsStore`, `useWidgetInstancesStore`, `useLocationStore`, `useGoogleAccountStore` (in-memory), `useUIStore` (in-memory)
- [x] `useSettingsStore`: `canvasBg`, `cardStyle`, `modePrefs`, `focusSearchBar`, `focusTasks`, focus search sub-settings, `mode='auto'`
- [x] `useWidgetInstancesStore`: `widgetSettings` map + `updateWidgetSetting`; mirrors to `widgetSettings_${id}` localStorage for Playwright compat
- [x] `useLocationStore`: 3-tier geolocation pipeline (browser → IP → hardcoded); Nominatim reverse-geocode; VPN detection; sun times
- [x] `useGoogleAccountStore`: connect/disconnect for all Google services; dispatches `google_account_changed` event
- [x] useWidgetInstances: add/remove widget instances dynamically
- [x] WidgetCatalog: categorized widget picker drawer
- [x] settingsIO: import/export widget settings
- [x] Keyboard shortcut: Alt+Shift+F to toggle Focus Mode

### Widgets (15 total)
- [x] **Clock** — 24h/12h, time-aware greetings, extra timezone rows, AM/PM inline; uses `onClockTick` from `sharedClock.js`
- [x] **Date Today** — weekday + BS/AD date
- [x] **Day Progress** (`progress`) — 24-dot grid
- [x] **Events** — localStorage, Google Calendar sync, create/delete, createPortal modals, Today/Tomorrow/Custom chips; `gcal_events_cache` in chrome.storage.local
- [x] **Countdown** — nearest future event from shared events; `COUNTDOWN_DONE` SW notification; `pomodoro_timer_state_${id}` per-instance state
- [x] **Calendar** — BS/AD toggle, event dots + tooltip, today = accent cell
- [x] **Weather** — **Open-Meteo** (no API key), geolocation via `useLocationStore`, °C/°F toggle
- [x] **Facts** — daily interesting fact
- [x] **Notes** — textarea, localStorage, color picker (WCAG contrast auto-detection), hide/expand/collapse
- [x] **Bookmarks** — Google Favicon API, chrome.topSites + manual Pinned, AddModal
- [x] **Quick Access** — top 6 chrome.topSites dock: favicon tiles, color extraction, letter fallback, hover scale

- [x] `"Default"` accent locked/disabled in dark mode, auto-switches to Blueberry
- [x] `clockFormat` setting (`24h`/`12h`) in `useSettingsStore`, shown in Focus Mode settings
- [x] Auto theme (`useAutoTheme`): follow sunrise/sunset (solar algo, 3-tier geolocation)

### Drag UX
- [x] `draggableHandle` on 3-dot pill notch — only the handle triggers drag, not full widget
- [x] Options button hidden during drag; no scale/transform during drag

### Accessibility
- [x] BaseWidget: `aria-label`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `role="menu"`, `role="menuitem"`
- [x] BaseSettingsModal: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, `aria-label` on close
- [x] Global `button:focus-visible` ring using `var(--w-accent)`

### Focus Mode (zones-based architecture)
- [x] **Zone layout**: `config.js` ZONES object as single source of truth; `zones/` (Top/Center/Left/Right/Bottom/BottomRight), `panels/` (9 panels), `dialog/` (4 dialogs), `theme.jsx` FM design tokens
- [x] **CenterZone** — digit roller clock (z25, above foreground overlay); Search bar pill below clock
- [x] **TopZone** — item-based InfoStrip (weatherIcon SVG + temp + date + year); canvas/fullscreen/settings buttons; auto-hides after 3s idle
- [x] **LeftZone** — glass panel cards: Pomodoro, Event, **Occasion**, Stock, Spotify (order from ZONES.left)
- [x] **RightZone** — World clocks; reads Zustand `useWidgetInstancesStore` directly via `useFocusTimezones()`
- [x] **BottomZone** — greeting text
- [x] **BottomRightZone** — Google Tasks collapsible pill (bottom-right, z22)
- [x] **BackgroundPicker** — shared component in `src/components/ui/`; 4 modes: default, curated (Unsplash library), custom (URL), orb (7 palettes)

- [x] **Focus Mode Settings** (`dialog/Settings.jsx`) — dateFormat, clockFormat, Search Bar toggle, Tasks toggle, Backgrounds button
- [x] **sharedClock.js** — Web Locks + BroadcastChannel leader-election; one tab holds lock and broadcasts second-aligned ticks; `onClockTick(fn)` API used by all zones
- [x] **useCenterOnDark** — returns `{ clock, search, greet }` booleans; Canvas pixel-sample
- [x] Fullscreen mode (Wake Lock API — keeps screen on)

### LookAway Eye-Break System
- [x] **LookAway overlay** — fullscreen eye-break with 3-orb animation, ring progress timer, 70+ witty messages (look away, drink water, stretch, talk to coworker, contact friend, check plant)
- [x] **7 color palettes** — random per overlay instance, independent of app accent
- [x] **Chrome alarm scheduling** — `UM_LOOKAWAY` alarm in SW; fires even when tab isn't open; `LOOKAWAY_SYNC` message to create/clear
- [x] **OS notifications** — optional notification when break is due (controlled by `lookAwayNotify`)
- [x] **Stale-break detection** — skips break if laptop was asleep during the interval (tracks `lastHiddenAt` via `visibilitychange`)
- [x] **Settings panel** — enable/disable toggle, interval picker (5–60 min), notification toggle, "Preview" button in dashboard Settings.jsx
- [x] **Dev fallback** — plain `setInterval` when no extension context available

### Stock Widget
- [x] Switched from nepalipaisa.com to merolagani.com API
- [x] Single clean fetch — 90-day daily OHLCV, LTP + prevClose + sparkline from same response
- [x] O/H/L always visible in single-stock view (flex-wrap, never clips)
- [x] Multi-symbol: 2-line rows (symbol above, price below) — no truncation

### Google Auth & Integrations

- [x] Pomodoro done notification + `COUNTDOWN_DONE` message
- [x] LookAway alarm handler (`UM_LOOKAWAY`); `LOOKAWAY_FIRE` manual preview message
- [x] Media session relay (`chromeSessions` map, up to 3 sessions)

### Media Session
- [x] `src/utilities/media.js` — content script injected into SoundCloud pages; detects playback via `navigator.mediaSession` + `<audio>/<video>` fallback

## 💡 Future Deliverables

### Focus Mode Enhancements

- [ ] **Focus Audio Scenes** — Web Audio API procedural ambient sounds (rain, binaural beats, Lo-Fi Kathmandu) that start when Focus Mode opens. Use `OscillatorNode`/`AudioBufferSourceNode` to generate rain/beats procedurally (no MP3 loop). Settings toggle in `dialog/Settings.jsx` (`onOpenAudioDialog`), new `dialog/Audio.jsx`; store `fmAudio` (scene key + volume) in `useSettingsStore`. No library needed — native Web Audio.
  > **rain.today verdict — not viable.** It's a consumer ambient site with no public API, no embeddable streams, and no developer integration surface. Its audio is served over HTTP with no CORS headers, which would be blocked by the MV3 extension CSP. The site was also unreachable during investigation (HTTP 429 / 404). Using external stream URLs would be a ToS violation and a reliability dependency.
  > **Chosen approach: 100% Web Audio API.** Rain = filtered `AudioBufferSourceNode` seeded with white-noise samples (`Math.random()`). Binaural beats = two `OscillatorNode`s detuned by 4–8 Hz (one per stereo channel via `PannerNode`). Temple Bell = decaying `OscillatorNode` with a custom `GainNode` envelope. All synthesized in-browser, zero network calls, works offline.
  > _Feasibility: Medium — no Web Audio in codebase yet; UI slots and settings pattern fully ready._

- [ ] **Focus Mode Color Grading** — Subtle tint overlay on the background photo (warm, cool, sepia, none) using CSS `mix-blend-mode`. Add `fmTint` field to `useSettingsStore` (`{ color, opacity, blend }`). Render a `<div>` at z-18 (between background z2 and cards z20) in `FocusMode/index.jsx`. `getPhotoTokens` could include a tint parameter if luminance logic needs updating. Picker in `dialog/Settings.jsx`.
  > _Feasibility: Very High — store + CSS layer only; no new dependencies._

- [ ] **Focus Session Log & Daily Score** — Track minutes in Focus Mode + interruptions (LookAway dismissed, tab switches). Persist daily aggregates to `fm_session_log` in `chrome.storage.local` (keyed by `YYYY-MM-DD`). Show a subtle score badge in TopZone/BottomZone. `useFocusMode.js` + `bg.js` visibility-change tracking already set up; extend with timestamps and accumulation logic.
  > _Feasibility: Medium — infrastructure (alarm, visibility, storage) exists; need scoring model + badge UI._

- [ ] **Focus Mode Manage Panels: "Undistracted Time" heatmap** — 7×24 opacity grid (GitHub-style) where each cell represents 1 hour of focused time. Renders as a new LeftZone panel or standalone widget. Reads from `fm_session_log`. Pure CSS grid + `opacity` derived from minutes-in-hour.
  > _Feasibility: Medium-High — storage tracking (from Session Log above) is the only prerequisite; the grid UI itself is straightforward._

### New Widgets

- [ ] **AQI (Air Quality Index)** — Open-Meteo AQI endpoint (free, no key) using existing lat/lon from `useLocationStore`. Show as a small breathing dot (green → purple) + PM2.5/AQI value inside the Weather widget or as a separate `aqi` widget. Extend `src/widgets/weather/utils.jsx` fetch logic or create `src/widgets/aqi/`.
  > _Feasibility: Very High — same Open-Meteo base URL, location already resolved, pattern matches existing weather calls._

- [ ] **Currency & Gold/Silver Rates** ("Market Pulse") — NPR exchange rates (NRB public API or forex.com) + gold/silver (MCX India or investing.com scrape). New `rates` widget following NEPSE stock pattern: sparkline optional, OHL-style rows. 5-min polling via `useWidgetInstancesStore`.
  > _Feasibility: Medium — widget/polling structure fully established; need to verify a reliable free API for NPR rates and gold/silver._

- [ ] **Daily Quotes Widget** — Hourly rotating wisdom quotes. `src/widgets/facts/` already does deterministic daily rotation with `getDailyIndex()` and 100+ entries in `data/facts.js`. Create sibling `src/widgets/quotes/` (or extend Facts) with a static bundled JSON of quotes + optional `api.quotable.io` fetch. Refresh on the hour via `onClockTick`.
  > _Feasibility: Very High — Facts widget is the template; near-identical implementation._

- [ ] **RSS / News Headlines** — User-defined RSS feeds or curated sources (Hacker News, BBC, Kantipur). New `rss` widget using `src/widgets/` pattern. Add `rss-parser` npm dep (lightweight) or parse via a small Vercel edge function to avoid CORS. Store feed URLs in `widgetSettings`. Auto-refresh every hour via `onClockTick`.
  > _Feasibility: Medium-High — widget system is mature; CORS requires proxy layer (Vercel edge fn fits existing `api/` pattern)._

- [ ] **Local LLM "Focus Partner"** — `@mlc-ai/web-llm` (WebLLM) running entirely in-browser (no API key). Summarize today's Google Tasks or provide a distraction-free chat. Integrate as a new BottomRightZone panel (slot exists, lazy-loaded pattern established). First model load is ~400MB so needs explicit user consent/download trigger; model cached in origin-private filesystem after first load.
  > _Feasibility: Medium — BottomRightZone slot ready, Tasks data available; `@mlc-ai/web-llm` adds a large bundle; needs user-gated model download flow._

### Canvas UX

- [ ] **Ghost Drag Mode** — During widget drag in WidgetGrid, show the dragged item as semi-transparent (`opacity: 0.35`, greyscale) while a ghost outline renders at the drop target. `WidgetGrid.jsx` already tracks `draggingId` state via `react-grid-layout` events; add CSS class on the dragged item and a placeholder-slot highlight. Pure CSS + minimal WidgetGrid change.
  > _Feasibility: Very High — `draggingId` already exists; CSS-only enhancement on top of existing `react-grid-layout` placeholder._

- [ ] **Command Palette (Cmd+K)** — Full command palette overlay. Commands: `/task [title]` (create Google Task), `/timer 25` (start Pomodoro), `/stock NEPSE:HDL` (jump to ticker), `/widget` (open WidgetCatalog). `Alt+Shift+F` keyboard pattern in `useFocusMode.js` is the model; `dialog/SearchBar.jsx` UI pattern is reusable. Register a global `Cmd+K` listener in `App.jsx`; build command registry mapping strings to store actions.
  > _Feasibility: High — keyboard infra + search dialog UI exist; command registry and dispatch logic are net-new._

### Testing & DX

- [ ] **Playwright Visual Regression / Widget Snapshot Tests** — Per-widget screenshot snapshots in light + dark mode using `expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()`. `playwright.config.js` and `tests/playwright/specs/` already set up. Use `settingsIO` to load a known config fixture before each snapshot. Add `--update-snapshots` CI flag.
  > _Feasibility: Very High — Playwright is configured; snapshot API is built-in; only need fixture configs and snapshot baseline._

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **Service Worker Background Pre-Fetch** — On `ALARM_TICK` (fires every minute in `bg.js`), periodically fetch weather + calendar data and cache to `chrome.storage.local`. App hydrates from cache on mount (instant display) and falls back to live fetch. Weather hook (`useWidgetInstancesStore`) and GCal cache (`gcal_events_cache`) already use `chrome.storage.local`; extend with SW-side fetch.
  > _Feasibility: High — alarm + storage pattern established; SW fetch + token forwarding needs care for auth-gated APIs (GCal)._

- [ ] **PWA Manifest (Desk Clock mode)** — Separate `vite build --mode pwa` output with a proper Web App Manifest and a Vite PWA service worker (`vite-plugin-pwa`). Allows pinning to secondary monitor/tablet as a standalone app. Requires parallel build config since `public/manifest.json` is currently the MV3 extension manifest (incompatible naming).
  > _Feasibility: Low-Medium — needs a parallel build pipeline; the extension and PWA manifests cannot share the same file; significant config overhead._
